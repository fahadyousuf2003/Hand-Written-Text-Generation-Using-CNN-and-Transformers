# Handwritten Text Generation Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project showcases a handwritten text generation model developed using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformer-based architectures. The model transforms digital text into realistic handwritten images, offering new possibilities for digitization and automation in various applications.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Neural Network Architecture**: Utilizes both CNN and Transformer models for accurate and efficient text generation.
- **Good-Quality Output**: Generates  realistic handwritten text, even for extended sentences.
- **Innovative Upscaling**: Ensures readability and quality by using a pretrained super-resolution model to enhance the generated text images.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fahadyousuf2003/Hand-Written-Text-Generation-Using-CNN-and-Transformers.git
    cd Hand-Written-Text-Generation-Using-CNN-and-Transformers
    ```

2. Run on either Google Colab or Jupyter and upload the dataset on your Google Drive.
   
3. If running on Google Colab, use the T4 GPU runtime.

## Model Architecture

### CNN Encoder
The CNN Encoder extracts features from input images through multiple convolutional and pooling layers.

### Transformer Decoder
The Transformer Decoder uses multi-head attention and feed-forward networks to generate  text images.

## Data Preparation

- **Image Data**: Images are preprocessed, resized, and normalized.
- **Text Data**: Text data is tokenized and padded for consistent input.

## Training

The model is trained to minimize mean squared error using the Adam optimizer. The training script includes options for adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size.

## Generating Handwritten Text

To generate handwritten text images, use the `generate_images` function. Customize the canvas size, character size, and output path as needed.
